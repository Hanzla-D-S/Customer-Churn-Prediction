# 🎯 Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **customer churn** for a credit card company using a **deep learning model**. By analyzing customer details and behavioral patterns, we can identify factors contributing to churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.  

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction Dataset** from Kaggle. The project involves:  
✔️ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and transforming data for modeling  
✔️ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding patterns and relationships  
✔️ **Deep Learning Model** – Built using **TensorFlow & Keras**
